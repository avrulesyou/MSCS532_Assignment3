Key FindingsThe results clearly show that while both algorithms perform well on random data, the Deterministic Quicksort suffers from catastrophic performance degradation (O(n2)) on sorted and reverse-sorted data. In contrast, Randomized Quicksort maintains its efficient O(nlogn) performance across all data distributions, proving it is a much more robust choice.Part 2: Interactive Hash TableThis script launches an interactive command-line menu to perform insert, search, and delete operations on a hash table.Run the script (No external dependencies required):python assignment3p2.py
python assignment3p2.py
