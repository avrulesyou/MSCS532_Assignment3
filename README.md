# Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability Analysis

This project provides the implementation and analysis for two key computer science algorithms as part of Assignment 3, focusing on the practical performance implications of different design choices.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

### Part 1: Randomized vs. Deterministic Quicksort
An empirical analysis comparing the performance of two Quicksort implementations to highlight the benefits of randomization.

### Part 2: Hashing with Chaining
An interactive implementation of a robust hash table that demonstrates collision resolution and dynamic resizing.

## ðŸš€ Running the Implementations

### Part 1: Quicksort Comparison
This script runs a performance comparison between Randomized and Deterministic Quicksort and generates a plot visualizing the results.

#### Setup
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Script
```bash
python assignment3p1.py
```

This will print timing data to the console and then display the plot.

#### Sample Output
```

```

#### Key Findings
The results clearly show that while both algorithms perform well on random data, the Deterministic Quicksort suffers from catastrophic performance degradation (O(nÂ²)) on sorted and reverse-sorted data. In contrast, Randomized Quicksort maintains its efficient O(nlogn) performance across all data distributions, proving it is a much more robust choice.
